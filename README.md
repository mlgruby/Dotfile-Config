# Dotfile-Config

Configuration file for zsh, git, htop, aliases.

For installation first intall stow ```sudo apt install stow```

then navigate to `stow` directory and then run `chmod +s stow-nix.sh && ./stow-nix.sh` for any natively installed linux. For wsl's use the same command but with different script `stow-wsl.sh`

Hope community will customize in other better way. Please send me pull request if you added cool features.
